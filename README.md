# NearestSentence
The goal is to find the two nearest sentences (in a meaning/semantic way) in the articles on the same topic.

# How does it work ?
## Install
First of all, install NLTK 3.0, downloadable for free from at https://www.nltk.org/install.html.
Follow the instructions there to download the version required for your platform.

Then clone the project

```{}
git clone  https://github.com/leirbag95/NearestSentence.git
```
## Find articles
Go on Google News and select 2 press articles (2 about the same topic).
Copy/paste the text content of each article in 2 separate files.

## Run it
For running the project copy/paste the follow command line
```{}
python3 wp1.py your_article1.txt your_article2.txt
```
[Debug mode]

```{}
python3 wp1.py your_article1.txt your_article2.txt -
```


## Result

For this example I selected 2 topics about the new iPhone (11 / 11 Pro)

The smallest Jaccard distance is 0.6, it concerns the 5th sentence in the article 1 and 2nd sentence in the article 2.
